### Themed Background [#](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/twbtw/into-the-feywild#Backgrounds)

#### Feylost 
You grew up in the Feywild after disappearing from your home plane as a child. Perhaps you were spirited away by kindly Fey who thought you were destined for great things. Perhaps you stumbled through a fey crossing by chance during a twilight stroll in the woods. Perhaps you were kidnapped by evil Fey but escaped from their clutches. Whatever the manner of your disappearance, you gradually fell under the Feywild’s spell and learned a little about the nature of the mercurial tricksters that dwell there.

When you finally returned to your home plane, you did not come back unchanged. You are haunted by the fact that the Feywild—a mirror world hidden behind a mere twist of perception—is only a hair’s breadth away. Although your memories of the Feywild grow fainter with each passing day, your heart swells with a mixture of fear and joy at the prospect of one day venturing back to the Plane of Faerie—your home away from home.

#### Witchlight Hand
Not preferred

### Traits [#](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/twbtw/into-the-feywild#CharacterTraits)

These tables, while optional, are well suited to Feywild-themed adventures and are ideal for any character who has the feylost or Witchlight hand background

#### Lost Things 
As a child you lost something, a trait, and feel compelled to seek it out.

## Adventure Intro [#](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/twbtw/witchlight-carnival#Chapter1WitchlightCarnival)

The main antagonists of this story are three hags who collectively form the Hourglass Coven, These hags are the adoptive sisters of Iggwilv, a powerful figure from D&D’s past and a key player in the adventure’s unfolding drama. Using an artifact called the hags have trapped an archfey named Zybilna in temporal stasis and carved up her fey domain among them. This domain is called Prismeer. To enter it, the characters must first visit the Witchlight Carnival, which travels across the Material Plane and appears on the characters’ world once every eight years. The carnival owners are a pair of shadar-kai (elves native to the Shadowfell) named Mister Witch and Mister Light, who can help or hinder the characters’ efforts to reach Prismeer.

One of the many novelties of this adventure is that the characters can accomplish their goals without resorting to violence—but only if they’re clever. They can fight their way through the adventure as well, but the odds won’t always be in their favor.
